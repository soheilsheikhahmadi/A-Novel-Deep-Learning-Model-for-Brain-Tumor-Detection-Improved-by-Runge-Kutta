For this research, the author devised an approach based on deep learning that is modified with Runge-Kutta Inspired Optimization (RKIO) Algorithm for the better classification of brain tumors. The idea RKIO applies differential equations utilizes is that it sets dynamically important hyperparameters such as the learning rate and weight increments, which greatly enhances the efficiency and convergence of the model to achieve the desired level. The technique uses pretrained Xception as a feature extractor and combines it with sophisticated data augmentation to improve the generalization performance. To ensure that the model does not overfit the training data, dropout layers are carefully included and a selective unfreezing during fine-tuning enables the model to adjust to the medical imaging data better. The experiments done on publicly available brain tumor MRI dataset gave excellent classification accuracy of 96.5% and high precision and recall. These results provide evidence on the applicability of the RKIO optimized technique to increase the reliability of medical imaging diagnostic systems and the further development of automatic diagnostic systems in medicine would be greatly benefitted.
